I am currently a M.S. student in [Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE)](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/), [South University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). Before this, I obtained my B.S. degree in Communication Engineering from South University of Science and Technology in 2019. My research interest includes many aspects of wireless sensing, especially using wireless signals such as Wi-Fi or millimeter wave (mmWave) to sense the surrounding environment and moving people which can provide a decision-making basis for communication.

I am now a member of LASSO Lab supervised by [Prof. Rui Wang](http://lasso.eee.sustech.edu.cn/).

You can find my CV here: [Chenqing Ji's CV](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

## Research Interests
- Wireless Sensing using RF signals such as LTE (4G/5G), Wi-Fi and mmWave
- Channel Modeling
- Mobile Computing (especially Mobile Healthcare)
- Computer Network (especially Wi-Fi protocols)
