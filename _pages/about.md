I am a M.S. student in [Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE)](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/), [South University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes many aspects of wireless sensing, especially using wireless signals such as LTE, Wi-Fi or millimeter wave (mmWave) to sense the surrounding environment and moving people which can provide a decision-making basis for communication.

I am currently studying in the **LA**b of Wireles**S** communications and **S**ystem **O**ptimization (LASSO) and being supervised by [Prof. WANG Rui](http://lasso.eee.sustech.edu.cn/).

You can find my detailed CV here: [Chenqing Ji's CV](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
