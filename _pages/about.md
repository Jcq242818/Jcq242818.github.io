I'm a First-year MS student from [Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE)](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/), [South University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). My research interest includes many aspects of wireless sensing, especially **I**ntegrated **S**ensing **A**nd **C**ommunication (ISAC).

I am now a member of LASSO Lab supervised by [Prof. Rui Wang](http://lasso.eee.sustech.edu.cn/).
